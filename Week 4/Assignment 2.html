                        Barbeque Boss was founded by entrepreneurs, John Radley Barrientos and Banjie Barrientos. The Barbeque Boss was founded in 1999 on their love and enthusiasm for cooking and serving delicious food, enjoyable company, and memorable moments with friends and family.

                        The business began as a little Duterte Street barbecue stall. There were just two workers and it was a simple grill-and-go stand. Employees call consumers on the street "Boss" in an attempt to get them in. They may be heard exclaiming, "Boss, Barbeque!" Grillmaster!The name stuck in their thoughts, and they decided to base the company's name on it since it was so catchyâ€”Barbeque Boss was created.
